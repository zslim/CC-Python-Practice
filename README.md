# CC-codes
A place to collect our code for practicing refactoring

Welcome! :) Please follow these steps to contribute:

1. Clone this repo on your computer in a folder that is **not** a git repository.
2. Create a folder under CC-codes with your name, for example: `Zsofi`.
3. Put your code in there that you would like to share with the others.
  * Be sure to exclude `.git` folders from copied material, we don't want nested git repos.
  * This can be done if you don't copy whole folders but create the folders in the repo by hand and then copy the files from your original folder by hand - without hidden objects like `.git`.
4. Go back to the repo root folder (CC-codes) and do a `git pull`. 
5. Commit your changes (the usual way: `git add .` first and then `git commit-m "added my code"` or something).
6. Go `git push`

You're done! \o/

Additional rules in order to avoid merge conflicts and keep this repo tidy:
* Please only modify your own folder in the repo.
  * Do not put new code into anyone else's directory
  * **Do not refactor code in the folder where it has been uploaded.** We need to allow everybody to see practice code in it's original form.
* Please avoid tracking files that are not pieces of code to be refactored. Anything else is irrelevant for the rest of the group.
  * If you want to put something like that into any folder under CC-codes please include the folder name in `.gitignore`.
  * I already added '\*refactoring/' to `.gitignore` so you can create a directory anywhere in the repo called refactoring and it will not be tracked. If you decide to do this, please put this folder into the root or into your own directory. You can put your chosen practice code there and git will not care about it.
  * Alternatively, you can copy the code you want to refactor somewhere outside this repository. It's a simple and elegant solution. :)


Happy refactoring! :)
