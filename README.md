# CC-codes
A place to collect our code for practicing refactoring

Welcome! :) Please follow these steps to contribute:

1. Clone this repo on you computer in a folder that is **not** a git repository.
2. Create a folder under CC-codes with your name, for example: `Zsofi`.
3. Put your code in there that you would like to share with the others.
4. Go back to the repo root folder (CC-codes) and commit the changes.
5. Go `git pull`
6. Go `git push`

You're done!

Additional rules in order to avoid merge conflicts:
* Please only modify your own folder in the repo
* If you choose a piece of code from someone else that you would refactor please copy it somewhere else before you modify it
  * Either create a `refactor` folder in you folder in this repo and modify code from others there
  * Or copy it somewhere outside this repository

Happy refactoring! :)
