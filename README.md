# CC-codes
A place to collect our code for practicing refactoring

Welcome! :) Please follow these steps to contribute:

1. Clone this repo on your computer in a folder that is **not** a git repository.
2. Create a folder under CC-codes with your name, for example: `Zsofi`.
3. Put your code in there that you would like to share with the others.
  * Be sure to exclude `.git` folders from copied material, we don't want nested git repos.
  * This can be done if you don't copy whole folders but create the folders in the repo by hand and then copy the files from your original folder by hand - without hidden objects like `.git`.
4. Go back to the repo root folder (CC-codes) and do a `git pull`. 
5. Commit your changes (the usual way: `git add .` first and then `git commit-m "added my code"` or something).
6. Go `git push`

You're done! \o/

Additional rules in order to avoid merge conflicts:
* Please only modify your own folder in the repo
* If you choose a piece of code from someone else that you would refactor please copy it somewhere else before you modify it
  * It's best if you copy it somewhere outside this repository so that you can pull down newly added code without having to commit your changes while you refactor.

Happy refactoring! :)
